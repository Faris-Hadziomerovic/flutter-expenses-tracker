# Personal Expenses Tracker

A small flutter mobile app project for tracking personal expenses.

You can add new transactions (with a title, cost and date), delete the preset dummy and your own transactions and see their impact on your expenses from last week.

In landscape we can choose between chart and list view via a switch button:

By clicking the + button either in the app bar or the floating action button a modal popup appears on the bottom of the screen:
